# Unstirrd
Unstirrd is a cocktail review app. Want to know where the best Negroni is in Montreal? Simply sign up for Unstirrd and look it up. You’re going to find where the best Negroni is, based on other Unstirrd member reviews. If you’re trying a new cocktail bar and you want to know what their best cocktail is, you can also look for it.

Unstirrd is inspired by the app [Untappd](https://untappd.com/) but adapted to cocktails instead of beers.

## **How it works**

**Looking for cocktail reviews**

You can either find a bar and look for its reviews, or you can look for a specific cocktail and know where in your selected region people reviewed it.

**Adding reviews**

Adding your own cocktail reviews is also important to ensure others can benefit from the app. You’re at a bar, you have just tried their Margarita and you really liked it. You can open your app, check in at the bar and rate your Margarita. If you don’t find the cocktail from the app list, you can also manually add it. The name of the cocktail is required, as well as the main ingredients, the type of glass and the recipe.

**Following people**

You can also follow other people. Your homefeed will allow you to know where they checked-in and which cocktails they've had.
